## Prepare!

You will read through the first nine chapters of Caleb Doxsey's [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) and discuss the material with an instructor.

## Recommended Practice

Here is the recommended practice for learners and instructors:

1. Read through a single chapter
2. Do all the exercises at the end of the chapter - most of them are super short
3. Schedule a 15-minute session with an instructor
  1. Explain the material back to the instructor in your own words
  2. Present your solutions to the instructor

During the session your instructor may choose to ask you additional questions about the material.

Chapter 13 is also recommended before starting [Exercise 1](https://github.com/enova/saigo/tree/master/exercise-001-corpus)
